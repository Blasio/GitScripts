Various scripts for use with Git.

autover-*:	Automatically generate part or all of a version string for a project.
setup-*:	Used to set up parts of a project.


autover/autover-GITSHA1
=======================

USAGE: autover-GITSHA1 <Template> <Target>

Copy <Template> to <Target> while replacing any occurences of $$ in <Template> with the first 8 characters of the current HEAD's commit SHA1.  Needs to be called by post-commit and post-checkout hooks to keep the <Target> file correctly synched.


autover/autover-vA.B.C-GITSHA1
==============================

USAGE: autover-vA.B.C-GITSHA1 <Template> <Target>

As for the above script, but replace $$ with C-GITSHA1 where C is the number of commits since the last signed or annotated tag matching 'v*' and GITSHA1 is again the first 8 characters of the commit's SHA1.  Typically I use these with tags such as 'v1.0' hence the name of the script.


setup-ignore
============

USAGE: Interactive Script.  Just run.

Uses a set of templates held in gitignore-templates to produce a .gitignore file for a project, based on the targets and/or tools specified.
